      <h1>Welcome to Aurelian Acres!</h1>
      <p>
        You are a legate sent by the one an only Marcus Aurelius. You have been entrusted to turn this land into a
        worthy province of the Roman Empire!
      </p>
      <p>Your goal is to build at least 20 units of each building and fill the city with workers.</p>
      <p>Workers provide more resources per click you make, while buildings will provide more resources passively. </p>
      <p>
        Click on the big coin to gain resources. Initially you will only gain gold by clicking, but as you keep
        expanding, your coin will provide more resources.
      </p>
